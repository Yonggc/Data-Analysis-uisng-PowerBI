# Data-Analysis-uisng-PowerBI
The project is about the data analysis of an automative manufacturing company whose profits have been declining over time because of the increase in plants operating costs. Major KPIs are used to track plant's operational process, such as Machine Utilization, Right First Time, Scrap rate, Downtime, Rework rate, and Production pieces.
Using PowerBI, KPIs and performance were analysed, visualization dashboard to track important KPIs are created, and recommendations are given.
